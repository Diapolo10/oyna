# Contributing to Oyna

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Oyna**, a project aimed at making learning Python enjoyable through the creation of simple games. Below are guidelines to help you contribute effectively while keeping the project's goals in mind.

## Purpose of the Project

The primary goal of **Oyna** is to help individuals learn Python by creating simple games that are easy to understand and enjoyable. In this project:

- **Simplicity** takes precedence over strict adherence to software engineering principles.
- When faced with a choice between simplicity and complex engineering practices, always prioritize simplicity to ensure code readability and accessibility for beginners.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Enhancing Existing Games
If you have a new solution or improvement for an existing game:
- Add your solution in the relevant game folder.
- Name the file as you wish, ensuring it is descriptive.
- Update the folder's `README.md` to include your approach, alongside the existing ones.
- Submit a **merge request** with your changes.

### 2. Adding a New Game
If you have a new game idea:
- Create a new folder for the game.
- Add your Python file with a descriptive name in this folder.
- Write a `README.md` file in the same folder. The `README.md` should include:
  - The name of the file.
  - A brief description of the algorithm used.
  - Instructions on how to play the game.
  - Any dependencies or libraries required.
- You can refer to examples in other folders for guidance.

### 3. Sharing Game Ideas
If you have an idea for a game, even if you cannot implement it yourself, feel free to share it with us. We would love to hear your creative thoughts!

### 4. Keeping Games Simple
To align with the project’s purpose, keep the games as simple as possible. Avoid adding unnecessary complexities such as:
- Elaborate menus or user guides.
- Extensive input validation.
- Features outside the core game mechanics that might make the algorithm harder to understand.

### 5. Fixing Bugs and Enhancing the Project
This project wasn’t started by professionals, and we welcome any contributions to:
- Improve the quality of the codebase.
- Fix bugs or inefficiencies.
- Add helpful comments or rename variables for clarity.
- Any other small or large enhancements that raise the project’s overall quality.

## Guidelines for Pull Requests
- Ensure your code follows the simplicity-first principle.
- Include relevant documentation or comments to explain your changes.
- Test your changes to ensure they work as intended.
- Be respectful and collaborative during discussions and code reviews.
