1. Improving Existing Games

- If you have a new approach for an existing game, create a new file in the corresponding folder with a name of your choice.
- Update the folder's `README.md` file to include your solution alongside the existing method.
- Submit a pull request (PR) with your changes.

2. Adding a New Game

- Create a new folder for your game.
- Add your Python file with a name of your choice in the folder.
- Create a `README.md` file in the same folder. At a minimum, include:
  - The name of the Python file.
  - The algorithm used.
  - How to play the game.
  - Any dependencies or special instructions.
- Refer to the examples in other folders for guidance.
