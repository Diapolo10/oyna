### How to Implement
This game is implemented as a grid table where elements are connected with their neighbors through links. When any button is pressed, the bird jumps and can pass through the cacti. To move cacti, the status of the cactus element is changed to `BLOCK` and the status of the left element is changed to `CACTUS`, If the cactus hits the bird, you lose.
