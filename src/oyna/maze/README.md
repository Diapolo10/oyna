# Maze

## Introduction
The Maze Game is a simple text-based adventure game where the player navigates a maze, trying to reach the destination (marked with üçì) while avoiding obstacles (external walls marked with üîπ and internal walls marked with üü™) and navigating through empty spaces (`  `). The player controls a character (üê•) that moves through the maze using keyboard inputs.

## [grid base](./grid_base.py)

### How to Play
- The player starts at the center of the maze.
- Use the following keys to move the character:
  - **`w`** - Move up
  - **`a`** - Move left
  - **`s`** - Move down
  - **`d`** - Move right
  - **`Space`** - Exit
- The goal is to navigate the maze and reach the end (üçì) without hitting walls (üîπ).

### Game Flow
1. **Start**: The game starts with a randomly generated maze. The player starts at the center.
2. **Movement**: Use the movement keys to navigate through the maze. The player can only move to adjacent cells that are not blocked by walls (üîπ).
3. **Goal**: The player wins when they reach the end (üçì).
4. **Exit**: Press the space bar end the game.

### How to Install and Run the Game
1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone or Download the Game**:
   - Download the game code or clone the repository from a GitHub link if available.

3. **Install Dependencies** (if required):
   - The game uses the `msvcrt` library (Windows only) or `termios` and `tty` (Linux/macOS) for capturing user input. These libraries should be pre-installed with Python.

4. **Run the Game**:
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, or Terminal on Linux/macOS).
   - Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the game.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     python grid_base.py
     ```

### Algorithm Overview
The maze is generated dynamically at the beginning of the game using the following approach:
- **Cell Representation**: Each cell in the maze is represented by an instance of the `Cell` class, which holds information about the cell's state (empty, wall, player, etc.) and its neighbors (left, right, up, down).

- **Board Setup**:
  - The maze is built with walls on the outer boundaries.
  - Random paths are created by marking every alternate cell as empty.
  - A player is placed at the center of the maze.
  - The exit (üçì) is placed at the bottom-right corner.

- **Maze Generation**:
  - The maze is generated by marking random cells as empty (for the path) and using walls to block off certain areas. The set_path() method ensures that the player always has a way to reach the endpoint by recursively creating an open path through the maze.
  - Path Creation: The maze path is created by randomly choosing available neighboring cells that are not blocked, and then continuing this process recursively until the player reaches the endpoint.
- **Movement**:
  - The `take()` method in the `Board` class handles the player's movement by checking the action (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, or space).
  - The player can move to adjacent empty cells or the exit, but cannot move into walls.

- **Game Progress**:
  - The game continues until the player reaches the end (üçì) or chooses to exit the game by pressing space.
  - The `player_has_reached_the_end()` method checks whether the player has reached the destination.

### Key Classes and Methods
#### `State` Enum
Defines the possible states for each cell in the maze:
- `BLOCK`: A blocked or unusable cell.
- `EMPTY`: An empty cell where the player can move.
- `PLAYER`: The player's position in the maze.
- `WALL`: A wall blocking movement.
- `END`: The destination cell where the player wins.

#### `Action` Enum
Defines the possible actions the player can take:
- `MOVE_UP`, `MOVE_DOWN`, `MOVE_LEFT`, `MOVE_RIGHT`: The possible movements.
- `EXIT`: The action to mark the endpoint.

#### `Cell` Class
Represents a single cell in the maze with the following attributes:
- `state`: The current state of the cell (empty, wall, etc.).
- `player_is_here`: A flag to indicate whether the player is in this cell.
- `set_neighbors()`: Sets the neighboring cells (left, right, up, down).
- `take()`: Executes an action (move or exit).

#### `Board` Class
Handles the entire maze grid, including cell setup, movement logic, and path generation.

#### `Game` Class
Manages the game loop and user interaction:
- `run()`: Starts the game and processes player input.
- `clear_screen()`: Clears the terminal screen between game updates.
- `print_board()`: Prints the current state of the maze.


### Final Thoughts
Enjoy navigating through the maze and trying to reach the endpoint (üçì)! The game provides an engaging and simple challenge, and you can keep playing to improve your skills in navigating the maze.
