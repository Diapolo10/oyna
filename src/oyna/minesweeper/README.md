## Simple Guide to the Game Code

### Game Overview
This code represents a basic **Minesweeper-style** game where the player navigates through a grid of cells that may contain bombs. The goal is to uncover all the safe cells without triggering a bomb. The player moves around using keyboard inputs and can flag suspected bomb cells, uncover hidden cells, or move around the grid.

### How to Play

1. **Controls**:
   - **w**: Move up
   - **a**: Move left
   - **s**: Move down
   - **d**: Move right
   - **e**: Uncover the cell (click action)
   - **q**: Flag the cell as a suspected bomb
   - **Space**: Mark a bomb (after triggering)

2. **Objective**:
   - The goal is to navigate the grid, uncover cells without hitting bombs, and flag suspected bombs. The player wins by uncovering all non-bomb cells, or loses if a bomb is triggered.

3. **Game Mechanics**:
   - The grid consists of cells that may be **empty** (numbered with a value showing nearby bombs) or contain a **bomb**.
   - Moving and uncovering cells reveal numbers representing adjacent bombs.
   - Players can flag cells they suspect contain bombs using the **flagging action**.
   - If you uncover a bomb, the game ends.

### Game Algorithm

1. **Initialization**:
   - The grid is created with a border of **walls**.
   - The player starts in the middle of the grid.
   - Random bomb placements are added to the grid, and neighboring cells are updated with bomb counts.

2. **Player Actions**:
   - The player moves around the grid using **w, a, s, d**.
   - The player can **click** on cells with **e** to reveal their content (either a number or a bomb).
   - The player can **flag** cells with **q** to mark them as potential bombs.
   - The game updates the grid based on the player's actions, revealing cells or showing flags.

3. **Winning/Losing Conditions**:
   - The player wins if all non-bomb cells are revealed.
   - The player loses if they click on a bomb.

### How to Install and Run the Code

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x is required to run this game.
   - The game uses `msvcrt` for Windows systems (for capturing keyboard inputs), but it also supports other platforms like Linux and macOS with the `termios` and `tty` libraries.

2. **Running the Game**:
   - Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the file.
   - Run the game with the following command:
     ```bash
     python grid_base.py
     ```
   - The game will begin and you can control it using the keyboard.

### Code Structure

1. **State Enum**:
   - Represents the different possible states of a cell, such as blocked, bomb, number of adjacent bombs, or the player's position.

2. **Action Enum**:
   - Defines the possible actions the player can take: moving in various directions, setting flags, or clicking on cells.

3. **Cell Class**:
   - Each **Cell** represents a single position in the grid. It tracks the cell's state (blocked, number of bombs, or bomb itself) and its neighboring cells.
   - The class also handles the logic for moving, uncovering, and flagging cells.

4. **Board Class**:
   - The **Board** class contains a grid of **Cell** objects. It manages the setup of the grid, including walls, the playerâ€™s initial position, and bomb placement.
   - It also handles actions performed by the player, such as moving and clicking.

5. **Game Class**:
   - The **Game** class is responsible for running the game loop, printing the board, and handling user inputs.
   - It uses the `Board` class to manage the state of the grid and the player's movements.
   - The game ends when the player triggers a bomb or wins by uncovering all non-bomb cells.

### Conclusion

This game provides a simple yet fun implementation of a Minesweeper-style game in Python. It uses basic programming concepts such as classes, enums, and event-driven logic to create a playable game. The user interacts with the game via the terminal, making it an easy-to-run and straightforward gaming experience.
